Create a barrier implementation using MPI and OpenMP

OpenMP
------
Dissemination
MCS

MPI (http://particlephysicsandcode.com/2012/11/04/installing-open-mpi-1-6-3-ubuntu-12-04-fedora/)
----
Dissemination
Tournament

Combined
---------


Things to Figure out
------------------
ln 43 in dissemination -> needed?
MPI -> fprintf sometimes out of order, but seems like actually in order when comparing data within the barrier itself (due to multiple processors?)
